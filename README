Vim configuration for Jack Mudge <jakykong@theanythingbox.com>

This may or may not be useful to anyone else, but please feel free to review it, adapt it, steal from it, or use it outright.

Be aware that this config is used frequently on a Windows machine, so the filename is _vimrc, not .vimrc. I use a symlink on Linux machines for keeping this in sync.
